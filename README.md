# multi-agent-a2a-system
This project demonstrates how to build a modular multi-agent AI assistant inspired by Google’s **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** Protocol. Each agent handles a specific task—translation, memory retrieval, real-time web search, and final LLM-based response generation—communicating over structured HTTP.
